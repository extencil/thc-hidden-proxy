# thc-hidden-proxy
i created this repository ~~because i have no mental sanity~~ with the aim of researching and creating new techniques for hiding connections. the idea is to encapsulate the protocols inside other less “suggestive” protocols and transport them inside CDNs.

# todo
- [ ] become clinically insane before starting this project

# history
the idea for this project came up in the HackersChoice telegram chat. i don't know if the group will still be active when you read this README, so look for the active community on the thc domain. they take great care to keep the social networks up to date there.

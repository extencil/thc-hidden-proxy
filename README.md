# thc-hidden-proxy
i created this repository ~~because i have no mental sanity~~ with the aim of researching and creating new techniques for hiding connections. the idea is to encapsulate the protocols inside other less “suggestive” protocols and transport them inside CDNs.

# todo
- [x] ~~become clinically insane before starting this project~~
- [ ] research and test protocol and message obfuscation with cloudflared, chiesel, gost, vmess, netcat, gsocket, or another one?
- [ ] test
- [ ] testing again
- [ ] more research
- [ ] test in controlled dummy laboratories
- [ ] test in real cyber labs on restricted networks
- [ ] not to be arrested? no, i'm joking. the idea is to test this guns and bullets inside corporate networks to establish an connection.

# history
the idea for this project came up from @[SkyperTHC](https://github.com/SkyperTHC) in some of hackerschoice's chat. i don't know if the group will still be active when you read this README, so look for the active community on the official hackerschoice domain:
- https://www.thc.org/

THC take great care to keep the social networks up to date there.

disclaimer: i will maintain this repository in whatever way is easiest for me until i understand that it needs to be professionalized. expect grammar mistakes, incorrect or misleading statements, and other minor flaws. when necessary, i will radically modify this repository.
